# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

This portfolio shows solid examples of my dedication and work over time. I have selected a few of my best work as a frontend web developer. I showcase my best work as a web developer with the view that potential employers will one day take interest in my work and efforts and invite me for job interviews. 

I have included the following pieces of work:
(1) Building a piano using HTML ad CSS as part of the freecodecamp course.
(2) Suzana Designs online shop, where I styled it using CSS.
(3) Using Chart JS, a JavaScript library that I sued to create some visuals for GDP from some few countries.
(4) Creating a skyline using HTML and CSS, as part my freecodecamp project work.

To assemble this portfolio, I created the framework using HTML and the rest using Bootstrap 5. 

The project was work hours and days of hard work and dedication to research information and apply some solutions. I would get stuck on every step of the work but resorting to research always yielded the solution. I read the Bootstrap library extensively and apply some templates, cards and code to suit the customer specifications. On average, I slept at 2am!
The portfolio is deployed at this link here: https://mikemupararano.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
