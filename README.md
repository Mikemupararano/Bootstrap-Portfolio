# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

This portfolio shows solid examples of my dedication and work over time. I have selected a few of my best work as a frontend web developer. I showcase my best work as a web developer with the view that potential employers will one day take interest in my work and efforts and invite me for job interviews. 

I have included the following pieces of work:
(1) Building a piano using HTML ad CSS as part of the freecodecamp course.
(2) Suzana Designs online shop, where I styled it using CSS.
(3) Using Chart JS, a JavaScript library that I sued to create some visuals for GDP from some few countries.
(4) Creating a skyline using HTML and CSS, as part my freecodecamp project work.

To assemble this portfolio, I created the framework using HTML, a little bit of CSS and the rest using Bootstrap 5. 

The project was work hours and days of hard work and dedication to research information and apply some solutions. I would get stuck on every step of the work but resorting to research always yielded the solution. I read the Bootstrap library extensively and apply some templates, cards and code to suit the customer specifications. On average, I slept at 2am!
The portfolio is deployed at this link here: https://mikemupararano.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/.

(1) For CSS code and bootstrap code links: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
(2) Bootstrap 5 icons: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
(3) I used the templates from this link to create tables and columns for my contact me section; https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/#how-they-work
(4) For the grid, in the work section, I used these templates: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#example
(5) The cards were designed using the following templates from this page: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#about
